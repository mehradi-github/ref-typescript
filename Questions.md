# Typescript

1.  what is Typescript?
    - TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
2.  Implicit vs Explicit Types
    - Implicit types come from TypeScript inferring the type based on a variable's initial value and look just like regular JavaScript.
    - Explicit types are when we intentionally provide the type using a special TypeScript syntax.
3.  What is interface in typescript
    - a feature of TypeScript that allows us to define the structure or shape of an object and specify the properties and methods that an object has or should have
4.  What is a type in typescript
    - a type is a convenient way to refer to the different properties and functions that a value has
5.  What is the difference between a type and an interface in typescrip
    - **interfaces are open and type aliases are closed**
6.  What is union in typescript
    - A union type describes a value that can be one of several types. We use the vertical bar ( | ) to separate each type, so number | string | boolean is the type of a value that can be a number , a string , or a boolean .
7.  What is a narrowed type?
    - the process of knowing the type of a variable is known as type narrowing, which is a way to assert the type to act based on the result. By doing this process, you can get a more specific type, allowing you to perform the correct action, and make your code more expressive and less error prone.
8.  What is void in typescript?
    - void: represents the return value of functions which don't return a value.
