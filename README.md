# Typescript

[TypeScript ](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

- TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.
- TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript
- TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.
